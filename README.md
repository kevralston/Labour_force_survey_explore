# Labour force survey explore

** Kevin Ralston 2018

this file is an exploration of the LFS. I have the 75, 85 95, 05, 15 LFS. 

I am just feeling it out for a couple of projects.
I am intersted in intergenerational ineqiality
I am also interested in country of birth and occupation in the context of brexit.

Basically it is an occupational history of immigrants. Showing the occupations and sectors they undertake/took within the labour market and regionally, by sex, age and in 
comparison to the non-immigrant population.

In comparison to non-migrants
